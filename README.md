Most Files can be ignored.  They are my different steps in making individual
 components of the project.
The file containing all the modules is the RecognitionPlusMap.py  
it contains the module to fly the drone with keyboard contorls, to show the 
video and object recognition, and the mapping function which shows where the 
drone has gone.  I planned to make the object detection add objects to the map
but I was unable to get that working for the time being.  I do plan to continue
working on that aspect.
